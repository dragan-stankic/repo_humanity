This package contains following files:
--------------------------------------


README_Dragan.Stankic.txt 	- this file 

( manual ) 
TC_Excel_Humanity.xlsx  	- Excel file with 30 TCs for Login / Forgot pswd / Add Employee , 

Note: focus is on Description , some steps are missing but I think my experience 
with similar functionality can be noticed


( automation Katalon Studio:  ) 
Automation_Katalon.zip  	- Katalon Studio project for automation of  3 TCs for Login 
TC_Excel_Humanity_Auto.xlsx  	- Data file for automation ( data driven) 

Note: Focus is on Login TCs, AddEmpployee is just recorded but not modified for data-driven testing , but it could be done similarly to Login  ( Email must be unique) 


BTW , there are some issues, mostly with special characters and numerics that could be used in First / Last name , like: 
Employees:: 
  Aaa>bbb ccc
  First1 Last1
  Hhh$%^ jkk77 **
  Sss"ggg LLLL
